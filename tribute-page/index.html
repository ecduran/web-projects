		  	<h4 class="text-justify" style="line-height: 25px;"> was one of the earliest American authors of motivational, personal development, working to inspire during one of the nation’s most challenging eras, the Great Depression. He is well known for his book Think and Grow Rich (1937) which has sold 20 million copies. Hill's works insisted that fervid expectations are essential to improving one's life.

		<h3>Here's the timeline of Napoleon Hill</h3>
			
			<div class="timeline-events">
			<ul>
				<li>Napoleon Hill was born Oliver Napoleon Hill on October 26, 1883.</li>
				<li>Hill entered law school, but withdrew for financial reasons. He landed a job with Bob Taylor’s Magazine that offered advice on achieving power and wealth. He interviewed Andrew Carnegie in 1908, a steel magnate.</li>
				<li>Carnegie challenged Hill to interview the wealthiest and most successful men of the time, and compile the philosophy of achievement behind their success, which he believed was the same for all achievers.</li>
				<li>Hill interviewed the most famous people of the time, including Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, George Eastman, Henry Ford, Elmer Gates, John D. Rockefeller, Charles M. Schwab, F.W. Woolworth, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.</li>
				<li>From 1919 to 1920, he brought out “Hill’s Golden Rule”, a magazine dedicated to the philosophy of success blended with biblical psalms and gospel teachings. Printed by George Williams, it was an instant hit.</li>
				<li>In 1920, he began a nationwide tour. Rifts between him and Williams, who seized control of the magazine, prompted Hill to move to New York. He started a magazine which became a bigger success.</li>
				<li>He established himself as philosopher-laureate of success and ethics. However, his colleagues’ action led to the newspaper’s closure. He moved to Ohio, and operated a college offering courses in journalism, advertising and public speaking.</li>
				<li>The Great Depression left him devoid of all that he had earned including his home and the dream school. However, the passion did not fade. In 1930 he published “The Magic Ladder to Success”</li>
				<li>He went to South Carolina to create a self-improvement course at William Plumer Jacobs’ request in 1941. Production of the 16-volume set, “Mental Dynamite”, was halted due to paper rationing during World War II.</li>
				<li>While lecturing in Chicago, he met W. Clement Stone. In 1952, they entered into a partnership to produce books and courses. He taught his Philosophy of Personal Achievement, and lectured on “Science of Success”.</li>
				<li>The period of his association with Stone saw him publish “How to Raise Your Own Salary”, “Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude”, and “Grow Rich With Peace of Mind”.</li>
				<li>In 1970, his book <q>Succeed and Grow Rich Through Persuasion</q> was published. After his death, his wife Annie Lou appointed Stone as the executive director of the Napoleon Hill Foundation.</li>
